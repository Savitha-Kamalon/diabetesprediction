# diabetesprediction

This project involves building a model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on various features such as glucose level, blood pressure, age, BMI, etc. The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains 768 observations with 8 features and a binary classification target variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes or not.

The project involves the following steps:

Data Gathering: The dataset is downloaded from a reliable source and explored to understand the various features, their distributions, and correlations.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and redundant features. Feature scaling is also performed to bring all the features on the same scale.

Feature Engineering: 

Model Selection: The best model that can provide the highest accuracy and lowest error rate is selected. Different machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, light gradient-boosting machine, and  xgboost are compared.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the selected model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

Hyperparameter Tuning: 

Model Deployment: Finally, the trained model is deployed using a web application, which takes input from the user and provides the predicted output.

The outcome of this project is a highly accurate machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a patient developing diabetes based on various features. This project can be useful for healthcare professionals to identify patients at high risk of developing diabetes and provide them with appropriate medical care.
